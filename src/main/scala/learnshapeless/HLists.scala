/** HLists are linked-list data structures that include type-information about all their elements. The H stands for
  * "heterogeneous", because the elements dont share a single "homogeneous" type. HLists are like tuples in that all
  * elements contribute to the overall type, but like lists in that they can grow, shrink, concat, fold etc.
  *
  * As HLists are constructed from typed values, a corresponding linked-list of types is constructed at the type-level.
  *
  * Shapeless provides many of the typical operations of a collections API over HLists, including take, drop, map, fold
  * and indexing. To map over an HList containing several element types, Shapeless introduces polymorphic functions (eg `Poly1`)
  * which, unlike regular mono-morphic functions, are defined for multiple input/output types.
  *
  * To perform transformations over HLists while preserving type information about all the elements requires type level
  * computation. This shows up in the signatures of shapeless library methods as implicit parameters that determine the output type.

    Some options to see the type of `ex_newton` printed out:
    (a) start the `sbt console`, and enter `:type learnshapeless.HLists.ex_newton`
    (b) if you are using Intellij, you can focus cursor on the expression and activate TypeInfo command (Ctrl-Shift-P on my Mac)
